Through his small company, Minimodels, Francis introduced a line of toy cars called Scalex in 1952. They were metal model racing cars with a unique type of clockwork motor. Understanding the need to develop and create new products, Francis adapted his cars to have electric motors - he named these electric cars Scalextric (Scalex - Electric). Later in 1957 Scalextric caused a sensation at the Harrogate Toy Fair. Now the cars ran on grooves, not rails, and picked up an electric current from beneath the groove with the aid of a \'gimbal\' wheel.\nDemand was so great that Minimodels could not produce the sheer number of sets needed. In 1958 Francis decided to sell out to the Lines Bros company, who operated under the name of Tri-ang.

It was equipped with diving boards and a wave machine, and was open between May and September. The pool\'s proximity to a power station gave it access to heated water, but also meant that it had to be covered for the duration of World War II to prevent it being used as a marker by German bombers. The actor Sean Connery served as a Portobello lifeguard in the post war period. The pool was closed in 1979, not long after the power station, and the area is now used for five-a-side football.","year":"1937","month":null,"day":null,"width":544,"height":768,"resolution":null,"device":null,"length":null,"is_readable":null,"created_at":"2014-08-05T22:42:27.824Z","updated_at":"2014-08-05T22:42:27.824Z","user_id":5,"attribution":null},{"id":105,"title":"Canal boat and the Bridge Inn at Ratho","file_type":"image","url":"https://edinburgh-stories-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/source/fafb05e4-8abe-4175-ac4e-5d40feeb209d/media.php","description":"Originally a separate village, Ratho is now considered to be part of Edinburgh.
